# Stock Prediction Model (LSTM)
•	Created an algorithm that predicts stock prices with an RMS Error as low as .15 for a 5 month period that resulted in 150% return on investments.

•	Implemented the use of a web scraper that can collect the historical stock information.

•	Visualized the data as a graph and a chart for quicker and more intuitive decision making.

•	Scaled and manipulated data in order to increase the model’s prediction accuracy.

•	Created data frames in the Python environment and implemented various machine learning APIs such as Tensor Flow, Keras and Pandas.
