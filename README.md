•	Created an algorithm that predicts stock prices with an RMS Error as low as .15 for a 5 month period.
•	Implemented the use of a web scraper that can collect the historical stock price from any stock.
•	Visualized the data as a graph and a chart for quicker and more intuitive decision making. 
•	Scaled and manipulated data in order to increase the model’s prediction. 
•	Created data frames in the Python environment and implemented various machine learning APIs such as Tensor Flow, Keras and Pandas.
